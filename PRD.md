**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-05-26  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Kieran Maynard

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

`transparency-reports-api` is a FastAPI service that exposes a read-only SQLite database (seeded from transparency-reporting datasets: the aggregated EU DSA VLOP transparency reports, tables 3–11, and Google Government content-removal requests) as a queryable HTTP API. Queries are described with **structured parameters** (a TikTok-Research-API-style boolean query, not SQL) and compiled server-side into a single parameterised SELECT. It is designed to demonstrate the **async-job / poll pattern** for long-running queries without tying up HTTP connections, behind a query interface that never executes caller-authored SQL.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Analysts and researchers who need to run ad-hoc queries against shared datasets face two pain points:

1. **Blocking HTTP** — long queries time out at proxies, load balancers, or client libraries before they complete.
2. **No isolation** — without per-user job scoping, users can see (or interfere with) each other's work.

`transparency-reports-api` solves both by introducing an asynchronous job model backed by a thread pool and a per-key access control layer.

### 1.3 Goals

| Goal | Success Metric |
|------|----------------|
| Demonstrate the 202 + poll pattern clearly | Demo script (`demo.py`) runs end-to-end without errors |
| Provide a safe, no-SQL query interface | Queries are structured parameters compiled to parameterised SQL; arbitrary SQL cannot be submitted and injection is structurally impossible |
| Scope jobs to the submitting user | A foreign job ID always returns 404, not the job's data |
| Be horizontally scalable with minimal changes | Swap `REDIS_URL` env var to switch from in-memory to Redis backend |

### 1.4 Non-Goals

- Production authentication (keys are hard-coded for demo purposes)
- Write access to the database
- Real-time streaming of query results
- Multi-database or cross-database queries

---

## 2. Users & Personas

### 2.1 Alice — The Researcher

Alice wants to run exploratory SQL against a public dataset from a notebook or script. She submits a query, polls until it finishes, and downloads the result as CSV for further analysis. She cares about **result fidelity** and **response format flexibility** (JSON vs CSV).

### 2.2 Bob — The Second Researcher

Bob runs independently on the same API instance. He should never see Alice's jobs — not even whether a job ID exists. He cares about **data isolation**.

### 2.3 Demo Operator

A developer giving a live presentation who runs `demo.py --pause` to step through the API flow interactively. They care about **legibility** (colored output, truncated JSON) and **resilience** (the demo should recover gracefully from a server not being ready).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Public Endpoints (no auth)

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-01 | `GET /` returns service metadata: API name, version, list of endpoints, current configuration (row limit, worker count, backing store type). The DB path is intentionally not exposed to avoid leaking internal server paths. |
| F-02 | `GET /healthz` always returns `{"status": "ok"}`. Used as a liveness probe. |
| F-03 | `GET /readyz` attempts a DB connection and returns `{"status": "ok"}` on success or `503` with an error detail on failure. Used as a readiness probe. |
| F-04 | Swagger UI is available at `/docs`; OpenAPI schema at `/openapi.json`. No auth required. |

### 3.2 Authentication

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-05 | All data endpoints require an `X-API-Key` header. Missing or unrecognized keys receive `401 Unauthorized`. |
| F-06 | API keys map to a user name (metadata). Default demo keys are `alice` and `bob`; the key-to-name mapping is configurable via `API_KEYS_JSON` env var. |
| F-07 | Jobs are owned by the API key that created them. Requests for another owner's job ID return `404 Not Found` (not `403`), preventing job-existence timing attacks. |

### 3.3 Schema Discovery

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-08 | `GET /tables` returns the list of all tables in the database. |
| F-09 | `GET /schema/{table}` returns column names, declared types, primary-key flag, and NOT NULL flag for the given table. |
| F-10 | A request for a non-existent table returns `404`. A table name containing invalid characters (e.g., semicolons) returns `400`. |

### 3.4 Query Submission

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-11 | `POST /query` accepts a structured JSON body that names a `table` (one of the 9 DSA report tables) plus a boolean `query` of `and`/`or`/`not` conditions and optional `fields`, `group_by`, `aggregates`, `sort`, `max_count` — **never raw SQL**. On a valid query it returns `202 Accepted` immediately with a job object and a `Location` header pointing to the job status URL. A missing/unknown `table` is rejected with `400`. |
| F-11a | The request is validated against the named table's fixed field registry (`TableSpec`) and compiled into a single parameterised SELECT (`compile_query`). All values are bound as parameters. Invalid queries (unknown table, field not in that table, illegal operation for a field type, bad aggregate alias, sort over a non-output column) are rejected synchronously with `400 Bad Request` and never become jobs. `GET /tables` lists the tables; `GET /fields?table=…` / `GET /schema/{table}` document each table's dimensions, measures, and operations. |
| F-12 | The compiled query is queued and executed on a background thread pool. The caller does not block waiting for execution. |
| F-13 | If the query result exceeds `ROW_LIMIT` rows (default 100,000), the job fails with a descriptive error asking the caller to lower `max_count`. |
| F-14 | Caller-authored SQL cannot be submitted at all, so there is no write/DDL path. As defence in depth the database is still opened read-only, so even a compiler bug could not mutate it. |
| F-15 | `POST /query` is rate-limited per API key: more than `QUERY_RATE_MAX_PER_WINDOW` (default 60) submissions within `QUERY_RATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 60) → `429` with a `Retry-After` header, before a job is created. Limits are independent per key. |
| F-16 | `POST /query` accepts an optional `callback_url`. When the job reaches `done`/`failed`, the server POSTs the job object (with signed `download_urls`) to that URL, HMAC-signed via `X-Webhook-Signature` (same secret as download URLs), retried up to `CALLBACK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` with backoff, off the query worker threads. Cancelled jobs don't notify. |
| F-16a | `callback_url` is SSRF-guarded: it must be plain `http(s)` to a publicly-routable host. URLs that are non-http(s) or resolve to private/loopback/link-local/reserved/metadata addresses are rejected with `400` at submit and re-validated before each delivery attempt (DNS-rebinding defence); redirects are not followed. `CALLBACK_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` disables the guard for local development only. |

### 3.5 Job Lifecycle

Jobs transition through the following states:

```
queued → running → done
                 → failed
       → cancelled   (DELETE while queued)
         running → cancelled   (DELETE while running; DB connection interrupted)
```

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-15 | `GET /jobs` lists the authenticated user's jobs, newest first, with a configurable `limit` query param. |
| F-16 | `GET /jobs/{id}` returns full job metadata: status, timestamps, row count, error message (if any), and a `result_url` (only when `status=done`). |
| F-17 | `DELETE /jobs/{id}` on a queued job marks it `cancelled` before it starts. On a running job it calls `sqlite3.interrupt()` to abort the in-flight query. In all cases the job is **immediately removed from the registry** after the status update, so subsequent requests for that job ID return `404 Not Found` rather than a `cancelled` status. |
| F-18 | Completed jobs (done/failed/cancelled) expire automatically after `JOB_TTL_SECONDS` (default: 86,400 s / 24 h) when a Redis backend is in use. |

### 3.6 Result Retrieval

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-19 | `GET /jobs/{id}/result` returns the query result when `status=done`. A `format` query param selects `json` (default) or `csv`. |
| F-20 | JSON format: `{"columns": [...], "rows": [[...], ...], "row_count": N}`. |
| F-21 | CSV format: standard RFC 4180 CSV with a header row. Response `Content-Type` is `text/csv`. |
| F-22 | If the job is not yet done, the endpoint returns `409 Conflict` with the current status. |
| F-23 | If the result has expired from the store, the endpoint returns `404` with a message indicating expiry. |
| F-24 | A `done` job's status object includes `download_urls` (`json` and `csv`): signed, expiring **capability URLs** for the result. The signature is an HMAC-SHA256 over `job_id:format:expires` using `DOWNLOAD_URL_SECRET`. |
| F-25 | `GET /jobs/{id}/download?format=…&expires=…&sig=…` serves the result as a file attachment **without an API key** — the valid signature is the authorisation. The signature is verified before any store lookup, so any invalid signature yields `403` regardless of whether the job id exists (no existence probing). An expired link yields `410`; a valid signature for a missing/expired job yields `404`; a not-yet-done job yields `409`. Link lifetime is `DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS` (default 3600). |

### 3.7 Researcher Portal

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| F-26 | `GET /portal` serves a single-page web UI (no API key) where a researcher signs in with a name + email. |
| F-27 | `POST /portal/register` (`{name, email}`) issues a working API key (`rk_…`) that authenticates every other endpoint via the same `X-API-Key` mechanism. Empty/whitespace name or invalid email → `400`; missing fields → `422`. No real authentication — production would use SSO. |
| F-27a | Issued keys are stored in an issued-key store (Redis when configured — surviving restarts and shared across workers — else in-memory), with an expiry of `ISSUED_KEY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30 days, returned as `expires_at`). |
| F-27b | Registration is rate-limited per client IP and per email: more than `PORTAL_REGISTER_MAX_PER_WINDOW` (default 10) within `PORTAL_REGISTER_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 3600) → `429`. |
| F-27c | `DELETE /portal/key` revokes the calling portal-issued key (configured demo keys → `400`); a revoked key no longer authenticates. |
| F-28 | After issuing the key, the portal page loads and displays the dataset schema (queryable dimensions/measures from `/fields`, and each table's columns from `/tables` + `/schema/{table}`) using the issued key. |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NF-01 | `POST /query` must return within **500 ms** regardless of query complexity (job is queued, not run inline). |
| NF-02 | The thread pool size is configurable via `WORKER_THREADS` (default: 4). Concurrent queries beyond pool capacity are queued, not rejected. |
| NF-03 | Query timeout is configurable via `QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default: 300 s). SQLite busy timeout enforces this limit. |

### 4.2 Reliability

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NF-04 | A database file not found at startup surfaces a clear error: `"demo.db not found — run python seed.py first."` |
| NF-05 | Unhandled exceptions in background threads are caught; the job transitions to `failed` with the exception type and message. No thread should crash silently. |

### 4.3 Security

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NF-06 | The SQLite database is opened with `mode=ro` (URI read-only flag). No app-layer SQL filtering is required or performed. |
| NF-07 | Job isolation (see F-07) prevents information leakage between users. |
| NF-08 | API keys in production deployments must be supplied via `API_KEYS_JSON` env var or a secret store, not hard-coded. (Demo keys are an explicit exception for local use.) |

### 4.4 Scalability

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NF-09 | When `REDIS_URL` (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) is set, the service uses a Redis-backed job store, enabling multiple instances to share job state. |
| NF-10 | The in-memory store is the default for single-instance / dev use. A process restart clears all jobs (documented behavior, not a bug). |

### 4.5 Operability

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| NF-11 | `/healthz` and `/readyz` are suitable as Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes respectively. |
| NF-11a | The service emits structured logs (JSON by default, `LOG_FORMAT=text` for humans): one line per HTTP request with method, path, status, `duration_ms`, and a `request_id` (returned as the `X-Request-ID` header), plus `job_submitted`/`job_started`/`job_done`/`job_failed` events with `job_id`, row count, and `duration_ms`. API keys are never logged. |
| NF-11b | `GET /metrics` exposes Prometheus metrics (unauthenticated, intended for an internal scrape): request counts and latency histograms labelled by the matched route template (so path cardinality stays bounded), plus job gauges/counters (`research_api_jobs_in_flight`, `research_api_jobs_total{status}`, `research_api_job_queue_depth`). |
| NF-12 | All timestamps are UTC ISO 8601 strings. |
| NF-13 | The service is 12-factor: all tunables (DB path, row limit, worker count, TTL, auth keys, Redis URL) are environment variables with sensible defaults. |

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 SQLite Schema (Star Schema)

The database is seeded from the aggregated [EU DSA VLOP transparency reports](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/) (`vlop-dsa.json`) — content-moderation statistics for 33 designated VLOP/VLOSE services for H2 2025, following tables 3–11 of the DSA Implementing Regulation template.

**Shared dimension tables** (`id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` = the row's position in the source lookup array):

| Table | Columns | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `services` | `id`, `name`, `platform` | Reporting service + parent company (e.g. YouTube / Google) |
| `categories` | `id`, `code`, `label` | DSA content category code + human label |
| `sections` | `id`, `name` | Report section (t7–t9) |
| `indicators` | `id`, `name` | Reported indicator (t7–t9, t11) |
| `scopes` | `id`, `name` | Scope/breakdown of a value |
| `surfaces` | `id`, `name` | Surface/sub-report (t6–t8; e.g. Core, Ads) |
| `meta` | `key`, `value` | Dataset metadata (`period`, `generated`) |

**Fact tables** — one per DSA report table, each with a `service_id` FK plus the dimensions and measures for that table. A query selects one via the `table` parameter:

| Table | Dimensions (FKs) | Measures |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `t3_member_state_orders` | category, scope | `orders_to_act`, `items`, `orders_to_provide_info` |
| `t4_notices` | category | `notices`, `tf_notices`, `items`, `tf_items`, `median_time`, `actions_law`, `actions_tos`, … |
| `t5_own_initiative_illegal` | category | `measures`, `automated`, `vis_*` (7), `monetary_*` (3), `service_*` (2), `account_*` (2) |
| `t6_own_initiative_tos` | category, surface | same 16 measures as t5 |
| `t7_appeals_recidivism` | section, indicator, scope, surface | `value` |
| `t8_automated_means` | section, indicator, scope, surface | `value` |
| `t9_human_resources` | section, indicator, scope | `value` |
| `t10_amar` | scope | `value` |
| `t11_qualitative` | indicator | `qualitative_text` (free text; no numeric measure) |

Each fact table is indexed on `service_id`. Fact rows are inserted positionally — the leading lookup indices in each source row land directly in the `*_id` columns.

### 5.2 Job Object

```
Job {
  id:            UUID (hex)
  sql:           string        # compiled parameterised SELECT (internal)
  params:        list           # bound parameters for the compiled SQL
  owner_key:     string        # API key (not exposed in responses)
  submitted_by:  string        # Display name from key metadata
  status:        enum { queued | running | done | failed | cancelled }
  submitted_at:  ISO 8601 UTC
  started_at:    ISO 8601 UTC | null
  finished_at:   ISO 8601 UTC | null
  error:         string | null
  row_count:     integer | null
}
```

Results (columns + rows) are stored separately from the job object, keyed by `job_id`, and expire with the job.

## 6. API Contract Summary

### 6.1 Submit a Query

**Request:**
```http
POST /query
X-API-Key: alice
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "table": "t4_notices",
  "group_by": ["service_name"],
  "aggregates": [{"function": "SUM", "field_name": "notices", "alias": "total"}],
  "sort": [{"field_name": "total", "order": "desc"}],
  "max_count": 5
}
```

**Response `202 Accepted`:**
```http
Location: /jobs/a1b2c3d4...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "status": "queued",
  "submitted_by": "alice",
  "submitted_at": "2026-05-26T12:00:00Z",
  "started_at": null,
  "finished_at": null,
  "error": null,
  "row_count": null,
  "status_url": "/jobs/a1b2c3d4..."
}
```

### 6.2 Poll for Completion

```http
GET /jobs/a1b2c3d4...
X-API-Key: alice
```

Returns the same job object with updated `status`, timestamps, and `row_count`. When `status=done`, a `result_url` field is also present.

### 6.3 Fetch Result

```http
GET /jobs/a1b2c3d4.../result?format=json
X-API-Key: alice
```

```json
{
  "columns": ["service_name", "total"],
  "rows": [["Google Maps", 975841], ["Facebook", 788745], ...],
  "row_count": 5
}
```

## 7. Configuration Reference

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| `DB_PATH` | `demo.db` | Path to the SQLite file |
| `ROW_LIMIT` | `100000` | Max rows per query result |
| `WORKER_THREADS` | `4` | Background thread pool size |
| `QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | SQLite busy timeout (seconds) |
| `JOB_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` | Completed job expiry (Redis only) |
| `API_KEYS_JSON` | (demo keys) | JSON map of `{key: {name: ...}}` |
| `REDIS_URL` | _(unset)_ | Redis connection URL |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | _(unset)_ | Upstash HTTP endpoint (alternative to REDIS_URL) |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Upstash auth token |

---

## 8. Error Reference

| HTTP Status | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| 400 | Invalid table name in `/schema/{table}` |
| 401 | Missing or invalid `X-API-Key` |
| 404 | Job not found (or belongs to another user) |
| 404 | Table not found in `/schema/{table}` |
| 404 | Result not found / expired |
| 409 | Result requested but job not in `done` state |
| 503 | Database unavailable at `/readyz` |

SQL errors and row-limit violations surface as `status=failed` with a human-readable `error` field on the job, not as HTTP errors.

---

## 9. Future Considerations

The following items are out of scope for this demo but are natural next steps for a production version:

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Persistent auth** | Replace hard-coded keys with a secret store (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) |
| **Rate limiting** | Per-key query concurrency or per-minute limits |
| **Query cost estimation** | EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN before running to reject expensive queries |
| **Streaming results** | Server-Sent Events or chunked transfer for very large result sets |
| **Result pagination** | Cursor-based pagination on `/jobs/{id}/result` |
| **Audit logging** | Structured logs of who ran what SQL and when |
| **Multiple databases** | Route queries to different DB files based on path or header |
| **Webhook callbacks** | POST to a caller-supplied URL when a job finishes (eliminates polling) |
| **Admin endpoints** | Metrics, job queue depth, active connection count |
